    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hi! I'm Sherezade (like lemonade), but most people call me Sherry. I love creating things - a new blog post, a barre fitness routine, or a new recipe. I love piecing things together to create something bigger and better.</p>
    <p>I am a self-proclaimed #crazydoglady and my fianc√© and I have two mutts by the names of Joey and Wade - they are our "wild things." Professionally, I am a scrum master (agile project manager) and a barre fitness instructor, but on my free time I like to drink all sorts of coffee, binge on Netflix shows, and pretend I'm a real runner.</p>
    <p>Life is good.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>I am currently a Scrum Master at 352 Inc., where I help my teams create beautiful digital products. I have a diverse work history, but my passion lies in communications and public relations. From a professional perspective, I think it's fascinating to connect an organization and its audiences through two-way communication to reach goals that are beneficial to all parties involved. Good research, measurable objectives, thorough planning and execution, and constant evaluation of progress can help you achieve any goal. My interests and strengths lie in:</p>

      <p class="p2"> I am also a certified barre instructor at Barre Forte. What began as a healthy hobby, turned into a questionably healthy obsession. The ballet-inspired workout incorporates small, isometric movements to tone, trim, and tighten your muscles without bulking them out. I am very passionate about barre and love creating creative routines, as well as being able to network with a group of health-conscious ladies.</p>

      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I was accepted into Florida International University as an undecided undergrad. After one week in my "Intro to PR" course, I knew right away that this career was meant for me. I balanced work and school semi-gracefully, always keeping a focus on my studies. In my junior year of college, I studied abroad in Perugia, Italy, where I took Italian courses and learned all about their language and culture. This is still one of my favorite life-experiences of all time.</p>
      <p> I graduated in 2011 with a PR internship and a good GPA under my belt. However, my natural desire to learn left me wanting more. I did some research into graduate degrees and that's when I came across the University of Florida's program, which was number one in the nation at the time. I always dreamed of being a Gator and I decided that grad school would only be worth it if it was at the school of my dreams (and the best of the best!). Spoiler alert: I was accepted!</p>
      <p>At UF, I strongly focused on health communications in pursuit of my belief that while "I do not have the skills to be a doctor, I can still help people in my own way." I took all sorts of classes, including: digital PR, philanthropy and fundraising, sports media and society, science and health communications, and the list goes on. My thesis focused on the effects of marketing e-cigarettes to minors, and was used by the county in support of banning e-cigarette sales to anyone under 18. That was one proud moment.</p>
      <p>I also held various jobs and internships while at UF -- I was even a Graduate Teaching Assistant and led my own public relations course. I consider myself a life-long learner. I am always looking into something new and I am grateful for every single experience I have had along the way. Go Gators!</p>
